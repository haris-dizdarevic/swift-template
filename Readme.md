### Pull request quality gates

- no conflicts with target branch
- pass AppCentar tests
- code review approval

## Tools

### Networking with Alamofire
Networking is implemented via [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) that enables easy parsing of response to Api Models inside app together with [AlamofireObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper) and [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper)

This project will run static code analyser on every commit.

### Static code analyser
This template us using [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for static code analysis. All SwiftLint offenses are automatically tracked and prevented on every commit. This feature is handled by [Overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit) git hook manager.

### Testing
